		Linux Device Drivers Course Examples
		------------------------------------

Notes

1. 	The following examples are distribution agnostic.

	These examples have worked on debian, ubuntu, suse, fedora etc.

2.	Also, the following examples are meant for the 2.6. kernel.

	All the examples (except the example in Chapter #10) will work 
	on any 2.6.xx kernel.

	As regards the example in Chapter #10, it will work on kernel 
	versions <2.6.20. 

	=>	I am currently working on getting that particular 
		example working for kernel version >= 2.6.20.
		send me an email, and, I'll send you the updates.

3.	The following are the Chapters (as laid out in the 3rd Edition 
	of the O'Reilly book on LDD by Corbet/Rubini/GKH) :

	Chapter_02
	Chapter_03
	Chapter_04
	Chapter_05
	Chapter_06
	Chapter_07
	Chapter_08
	Chapter_09
	Chapter_10
	Chapter_11
	Chapter_12
	Chapter_16
	Chapter_17

	These are not the same "sample" examples as provided on their
	site.

4.	As regards to the layout,

	=> Each Chapter has a directory.

	=> Each Chapter directory, has an "Examples" directory.  

	=> Each Examples Directory, has one or more directories 
	   - each containing a Makefile and one or more C source files.

	=> log in as root.
	   and, run 'make' at the Linux Shell prompt

	   ** Do make sure that you have logged-in or su .. as 'root' **
